Car Data Mining
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (entrypoint.ipynb) that performs web scraping and data mining on a car listing website (ad.co.il) using Python, Selenium, Pandas, and BeautifulSoup. The notebook extracts relevant data from the website, cleans and preprocesses it, and exports the data to a CSV file (Data mining.csv).
